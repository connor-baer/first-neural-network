# My Udacity Projects

_Organized by course_

## [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)

> In this program, youâ€™ll cover topics like Keras and TensorFlow, convolutional and recurrent networks, deep reinforcement learning, and GANs. This is the ideal point-of-entry into the field of AI.

### [Your First Neural Network](https://connor-baer.github.io/udacity/deep-learning-foundations/first-neural-network/)

> In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!
